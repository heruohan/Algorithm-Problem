Problem 327:Count of Range Sum
  Given an integer array nums, return the number of range sums
that lie in [lower, upper] inclusive.Range sum S(i, j) is 
defined as the sum of the elements in nums between
indices i and j (i â‰¤ j), inclusive.

Note:
A naive algorithm of O(n2) is trivial.
You MUST do better than that.

Example:
Input: nums = [-2,5,-1], lower = -2, upper = 2
Output:3
Explanation:The three ranges are : [0,0], [2,2], [0,2] and 
their respective sums are: -2, -1, 2.
